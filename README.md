## Star Wars Back End API

This project was built using ASP.NET Core MVC and utilized the following API: https://swapi.dev/. Firstly a Starship model was created based on the API. The data returned from the API was then used to seed the SQL database. Bootstrap was used to display the information and CRUD was implemented to manipulate the data stored in the database.
